            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AMONG all the places of Scripture, which they of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> are wont to alledge for a proof of their pretended
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> I find none whereon they more rely, than that of S.
<hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy 1 III. 15. That thou may'ſt know how thou oughteſt to behave thy ſelf in the houſe of God, which is the CHURCH of the living God, the PILLAR AND GROUND OF THE TRUTH.</hi> Which place, ſay the
<hi>Rhemiſts, pincheth the Hereticks wonderfully, and ſo it ever did: and therefore they oppoſe themſelves directly againſt the very letter and confeſſed ſenſe of the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have thought it therefore worth my pains, to ſhow how unjuſt this accuſation is; by opening the plain and evident meaning, the literal and confeſſed ſenſe of thoſe words: whereby it will appear that we are far from being <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and that they, not we, are <hi>pinched</hi> by this place; and that there is no ground at all in it for their Infallibility; nor for their vain flouriſhes, that the <hi>very Name of CHURCH terrifies us, and makes us pale with fear</hi> (as <hi>Campian</hi> inſolently vapoured<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ratio <hi>III.</hi>
               </note>,) and that we not only <hi>fear, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together abhor the word CATHOLIQUE, ſo as to leave it clean out of our Bibles,</hi> as the fore-named
<hi>Rhemiſts</hi>
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Preface to Epiſtle of S.
<hi>James.</hi>
               </note> moſt ſenſleſly miſrepreſent us.</p>
            <p>For as I have proved, in the following Book, that <hi>we,</hi> not
<hi>they</hi> are the true CATHOLIQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ES, ſo there is <pb facs="tcp:62912:3"/>nothing further from truth, (I have likewiſe ſhown) than that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks, with any particular reſpect, to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which is ſo far from ſtriking any terror into us, when it appropriates to it ſelf the name of CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCH; that we look upon the pretence to be as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as the proof is, they give us of it. Which is the ſole Authority of a falſe S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Commentaries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place; who thus gloſſes: <hi>All the World being God's, yet the Church only is his Houſe: the Rector (or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler) whereof at this time is DAMASUS.</hi> Where the
<hi>Rhemiſts</hi>

                  <hi>Annot. in</hi> 1 Tim. III.

And further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this conceit, in theſe words, <hi>The Church which is the Houſe of God, whoſe Rector</hi> (ſaith S. Ambroſe) <hi>in his time was</hi> Damaſus, <hi>and now</hi> Gregory <hi>the thirteenth; and in the Apoſtles time S.</hi> Peter, <hi>is the Pillar of Truth, the eſtabliſhment of Verity: and therefore it cannot err.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly it is worth our noting how clear a Caſe it is, that they were ſorely <hi>pinched</hi> (to uſe their own word again) for want of proofs; when they betook themſelves to ſuch as this. For it is hard to think that Men of their education (whom we will not deſpiſe, as they do the Hereticks, a little before<note n="(d)" place="margin">

<hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe he had been the Author, or theſe the Work of ſome <hi>celebrated</hi> Writer, it is a <hi>clear caſe</hi> (and I deſire it may be noted) that theſe <hi>Rhemiſt</hi> Annotators were not ſo <hi>knowing</hi> as they would be eſteemed, or not ſo
<hi>conſcientious</hi> as they ought to have been; when they gather from theſe words that <hi>Damaſus</hi> was Ruler over more than his own See,
<hi>even over the Univerſal Church,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter,</hi> they ſay, was in the Apoſtles times. For S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> himſelf ſaith, in his Book of the <hi>Prieſtly Dignity</hi>

<hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth</hi> here ſpoken of; as I doubt not I have proved in the inſuing Diſcourſe. Wherein I have alſo ſhewn, that other ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Biſhops, in other Churches, had the ſame title; nay, many perſons in the Church, that were no Biſhops: who were far from thinking themſelves, or being thought by others, infallible; as theſe
<hi>Annotators</hi> imagine they muſt needs be, who are <hi>the Pillar and eſtabliſhment of the Truth.</hi> That's an inference from theſe words, for which they had no more warrant; than they had to intitle S.
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> to thoſe Commentaries.</p>
            <p>The Author of which alſo did ſo little dream of the Infallibility of the Church, when he gloſſed upon theſe words; that he doth not ſo much as make the Church, <hi>the Ground or eſtabliſhment of the Truth:</hi> But ſaith in plain terms, <hi>Firmamentum</hi> (as the Vulgar Latine tranſlates <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>From whence alone we ought to derive our knowledge of <hi>the Truth,</hi> the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of: as is moſt clearly reſolved by S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> in theſe memorable words.<note n="(l)" place="margin">Catech. <hi>IV.</hi> Sect. de Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Saycto.</note>

            <p>Of this I have given ſo full and ſo clear an account in theſe Papers, that I fear not to expoſe them to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them that are of a contrary mind: hoping, though they do not convince them of their errors yet, they will help to eſtabliſh the People of our Church, in

                  <p>IT is a pious reflection which <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> makes upon a ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> that if
<q rend="margQuotes">

                        <hi>but either from God himſelf, or from his dependents;</hi> then we, who have the teſtimonies of the Divine Oracles, do juſtly boaſt, that we are taught the truth, by the very Son of God.</q> Which he hath revealed unto us ſo plainly in all things neceſſary to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tranſmitted unto us ſo intirely in the Holy Scriptures; that it cannot but be a great trouble to all thoſe who love him and his Religion, to ſee ſuch wranglings about it in his Church, as if there were no more certainty among us, <hi>what is truth;</hi> than there was among the Philoſophers.</p>
                  <p>The contention about this is ſo ſharp and fierce, that while Men ſeek after <hi>Truth,</hi> they are in danger to loſe the very aim and ſcope of it, which is <hi>Charity:</hi> the love of God and of one another. This S. <hi>Paul</hi> determines to be the very drift of the Goſpel, when he tells <hi>Timothy, the end of the commandment is charity,</hi> 1 I.
5.</p>
                  <p>Nay, they have raiſed ſo many doubts about this matter, that poor People are many times to ſeek for Truth it ſelf, even in the cleareſt light thereof. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Mens buſineſs, ſo to confound their thoughts, <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62912:7"/>that they know it not when they ſee it: but are ſtill in great trouble about it, even when they have it.</p>
                  <p>And where to ſeek for it, is now grown a great queſtion alſo. It is to be found, no doubt, in the Church; but about that there are ſo many diſputes, that Men are to ſeek as much as before, if they go to find it there. In ſhort, there are no words more abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed than theſe two;
<hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Church:</hi> and therefore I hope it will do ſome ſervice to Souls, if for their plain and ſafe direction in theſe matters, I reſcue thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 III. 15.
<hi>[the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth.]</hi> from thoſe falſe gloſſes that are put upon them, to the great diſhonour of our bleſſed Lord, and of his Holy Truth.</p>
                  <p>And for that end, I ſhall diſtinctly treat of theſe four things:

                        <item>Firſt, <hi>What that truth is,</hi> of which either the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Timothy,</hi> or both, were the <hi>Pillar and Ground.</hi>

                     <head>I. What is <hi>the Truth?</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>Here we muſt begin; becauſe we muſt firſt know what the <hi>Truth</hi> is, before we can know a Society of Men to be the
<hi>Church:</hi> which is conſtituted and made by believing and profeſſing the Truth.</p>
                     <p>And this in effect, is a reſolution of that queſtion, which <hi>Pilate</hi> askt our Saviour, but would not ſtay for an anſwer,
<hi>What is Truth?</hi>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62912:7"/>
                     <p>Which though it be made a great difficulty by thoſe, whoſe intereſt it is to make things intricate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed; yet, in my opinion, it is very eaſie to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to it; and we need not go far neither, to ſeek it. For the Apoſtle himſelf immediately explains what he means by Truth in the words following; <hi>and without Controverſie great is the myſtery of godlineſs; God was manifeſted in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World, received up into Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where we learn <hi>two</hi> things in general, concerning this matter. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that <hi>the truth</hi> here ſpoken of, is that which was formerly a <hi>Myſtery</hi> or Secret, which lay hidden for many Ages and Generations, in the unknown purpoſe of God, but now is revealed and manifeſted, by the Son of God, and his holy Spirit, to make Men godly.</p>
                     <p>Which is the other thing we learn from thence, that <hi>the truth,</hi> which the Apoſtle intends, is <hi>the Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> or as he he ſpeaks in the VI. Chapter v. 3. <hi>the Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs.</hi> And therefore whatſoever doth not tend to better Mens lives, by making them do their duties faithfully both towards God, and towards Men (to ſome of which the duties that are owing, are in this very Epiſtle called <hi>ſhewing Piety or Godlineſs,</hi> v. 4.) we are not to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon it among the truths, which were depoſited with <hi>Timothy</hi> to be preferred and upheld in the Church. For God did not deſign by the diſcovery he made of his Mind and Will, in the Goſpel, merely to enlarge our knowledge: but to rectifie our wills and affections, by the right information of our minds, and by acquainting us with ſuch weighty truths, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch wonderful revelations of his love, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but irreſiſtably ſway us, if we lay them to heart, unto his Obedience.</p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62912:8"/>
                     <p>But, that we may not be left to gueſs at this truth, or
<hi>myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> without any certainty, he ſets down a particular of it: and reduces the whole myſtery of Godlineſs, to theſe Six heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The principal is this, that <hi>the eternal Son of God, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghoſt of the Virgin Mary, and was made Man; that he might ſuffer for us, and make himſelf an offering for our ſins.</hi> All this I take to be included in theſe words,
<hi>God was manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> Which cannot be meant of God the Father, for it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſaid in other places, that it was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt who came in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Joh. IV. 2. and is here declared to be
<hi>God,</hi> that is, the eternal Son of God, the <hi>Word made fleſh,</hi>
1 Joh. 14. Which doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note merely his being <hi>made Man,</hi> but likewiſe his <hi>ſuffering</hi> for us: he taking our <hi>fleſh</hi> on purpoſe, for this very end, that therein he might, by his Death, make an atonement for Sin. And ſo the very phraſe <hi>fleſh and blood</hi> ſignifies in Scripture (as it doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers) this <hi>weak, frail, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ſuffering</hi> State, wherein we are at preſent: into which our bleſſed Lord put himſelf, when he manifeſted himſelf in our fleſh. So we read ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly, II. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 14. where to take part with us, in our <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> is to make himſelf liable to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and death. In theſe few words therefore, are contained many principles of Chriſtian truths, <hi>viz.</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt was really God (not God the Father, whoſe being is here ſuppoſed, but God the Son) and that he was incarnate, and really made Man, of the Subſtance of his Mother: being perfect God, and perfect Man: and as really <hi>ſuffered for us in the fleſh,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 IV. 1. Which were <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62912:8"/>the Doctrines that were firſt aſſaulted by the Devil, and his Agents in the beginning of our Religion (ſuch as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and the reſt of that Tribe) but proved to be undoubtedly true, by the mighty power of his Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Which is the ſecond part of this Myſtery,
<hi>juſtified in,</hi> or <hi>by the Spirit.</hi> Which ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced all gain-ſayers, that he was no leſs than the Son of God,
<hi>though in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh; and that by a Sacrifice for ſin, he condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> VIII. Rom. 3. For as he was conceived in his Mothers Womb, by the Holy Ghoſt, I. <hi>Luke</hi> 35. So at his Baptiſm he was <hi>anointed with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt and with power</hi> (X. Act. 38.) there being then a viſible deſcent of the Spirit of God, in a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner upon him, together with a voice from Heaven, ſaying,
<hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> III. Matt. 17. And as it then <hi>lighted on him,</hi> ſo it abode, and <hi>remained on him,</hi> I. Joh. 32, 33. as appeared by the power of ſuch Miracles, as neither Men nor Devils could work, but only the Spirit of God. Which was ſo evidently true, that to aſcribe them to the Devil, was <hi>the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> XII. Matt. 28.31, 32. III. Mark 29, 30. by whoſe power not only Devils were caſt out, but even the Dead were raiſed: whereby he was manifeſted to be <hi>the reſurrection and the life,</hi> XI. Joh. 25. By the ſame Spirit he himſelf alſo was raiſed from the Dead, and declared again <hi>the Son of God with power,</hi> I. Rom. 4. And having
<hi>all power in Heaven and Earth</hi> given him, he ſent the Holy Ghoſt upon his Apoſtles on the day of Pentecoſt, as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juſtification of him, XV. <hi>Joh.</hi> 26. V. <hi>Act.</hi> 32. Nay, more than this, by the laying on of their hands <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62912:9"/>poured it out upon others, who believed on his Name, II. <hi>Act.</hi> 38. VIII. 17. Which was the <hi>unction from the Holy One,</hi> whereby they <hi>knew all things,</hi> as St.
<hi>John</hi> calls it 1. II. 20. <hi>i. e.</hi> were aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all the Chriſtian <hi>Truth,</hi> revealed unto them. For all theſe, were illuſtrious witneſſes unto Chriſt, and juſtified this grand truth that he was <hi>God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh</hi> (for ſuch ends and purpoſes, as he pretended) againſt all oppoſers, who accuſed it of falſity.</p>
                     <p>And who is there that doth not ſee ſeveral other principles of God's holy Truth, contained in this? particularly that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt</hi> is God, the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Holy Trinity, being the
<hi>Spirit of God:</hi> which <hi>knows the things of God</hi> (as the Spirit of Man doth what is in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> II. 11.) and led or gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Apoſtles into all Truth, XVI. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. and dwells in the whole body of the Church, as his <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> 1 Cor. VI. 19. (which no created Spirit can do) and gave ſuch a Divine teſtimony to our Saviour, that to ſpeak againſt it, was <hi>unpardonable blaſphemy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That other great article of our Faith alſo is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> declares in theſe terms: <hi>Though he was crucified through weakneſs, yet he liveth by the power of God,</hi> 2 Corinth. XIII. 4.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. This was a thing notorious to the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: which is the <hi>third</hi> particular in this Myſtery;
<hi>Was ſeen of Angels:</hi> both at his <hi>birth,</hi> III. Luke 9, 10, 13. and in ſeveral paſſages of his <hi>life,</hi> IV. Matt. 11. XVII. 5. I. Joh. 51. and at his <hi>death,</hi> XXII. Luke 43. and at and after his
<hi>Reſurrection,</hi> XXVIII. Matt. 2. XX. Joh. 20. and alſo at his
<hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> I. Act. 10, 11. when they teſtified to the Apoſtles that this <hi>ſame Jeſus who was taken up from them into Heaven, ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62912:9"/>ſo come, in like manner as they had ſeen him go into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Where when he came, they <hi>all Worſhipped him,</hi> I. Hebr.
6. and admired at the wonderful Wiſdom of God, which was made known to them by the Church (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> I. 12.) eſpecially this <hi>Myſtery of Chriſt,</hi> as the Scripture calls it, which is the <hi>fourth</hi> particular in this Catalogue of Chriſtian Truths.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. That this Doctrine, thus confirmed and atteſted, was <hi>preached unto the</hi> Gentiles: who were aſſured, that they ſhould be made fellow-heirs with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and partakers of God's Promiſe in Chriſt, by the Goſpel, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks (III.
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.) <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom this grace was given, to preach among the Gentiles the unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches of Chriſt; and to make all Men know, what is the fellowſhip of the Myſtery, which from the beginning of the World was hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An aſtoniſhing Grace this was; declaring the infinite love and kindneſs of God: that they who thought not of it, who had no promiſes to make them expect it, who were ſtrangers to God and the Covenant of Promiſe, were on a ſudden ſurprized with the revelation of God's good will to them in Chriſt; and by belief of it, were made <hi>fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God.</hi> That is, the Church was made truly <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique;</hi> all the World being taken into fellowſhip with the Apoſtles, <hi>whoſe fellowſhip was with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. I. 3.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. And another great wonder was, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the oppoſition which was made by the Potentates, by the Philoſophers, and Diſputers of the World, by the Devil alſo and his Angels (who though they alſo <hi>ſaw</hi>

(out of the Holy Scriptures, he means, as appears by what follows); <hi>And ſuppoſe the Apoſtles had not left us the Scriptures, ſhall we not follow the Order of the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (or Rule of Faith) <hi>which they delivered to thoſe, unto whom they committed the Churches? To which Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation many barbarous Nations, who believe on Chriſt, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, having the Doctrine of Salvation, without Paper and Ink, written by the Spirit in their Heart, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently preſerving the ANCIENT TRADITION: believing in one God, the maker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things which are therein, by Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God; Who out of his moſt eminent love to his Creature vouchſafed to be born of the Virgin, uniting Man to God by himſelf; and ſuffering under</hi> Pontius Pilate,
<hi>and riſing again, and being illuſtriouſly received in glory, ſhall come again, the Saviour of thoſe that are ſaved, and the Judge of thoſe that are judged: Sending into eternal fire, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapers of Truth, and the contemners of his Father, and of his coming. Thoſe that have believed this Faith without Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we, in our Language, call barbarous: but as to their opinion, and cuſtom, and converſation, they pleaſe God, becauſe of their Faith, by which they are moſt wiſe: living in all Righteouſneſs, Chaſtity, and Wiſdom. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom, if any one ſhould ſpeak in their Language, thoſe things which Hereticks have invented; they would preſently ſtop their ears, and run away, not induring to hear the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62912:13"/>Thus by that OLD TRADITION of the Apoſtles</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Creed) <hi>they do not ſo much as admit into their thoughts, the portentous talk of thoſe</hi> Hereticks in his days.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things I have thought fit to ſet down, the more largely, becauſe they are an evident demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what the OLD TRADITION of the Apoſtles is; which is nothing elſe, but that ſummary of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Truth contained in the Creed: unto which they would ſuffer no other Tradition to be added; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with this, as fully ſufficient: and by this judged of all other things, that pretended to come from the Apoſtles: and were every where ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in this, that in thoſe Churches which as yet had not received the Apoſtolical Writings (the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the N. T.) they had this Doctrine, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of thoſe Scriptures: and were thought <hi>moſt wiſe</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſe enough to ſalvation) in this faith alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this is ſuch a very important Truth, I ſhall take a little more pains, to ſet down the ſenſe of the Church in all Ages, concerning it: that the Reader may be ſatisfied, there is no other Truth, but this alone, which is abſolutely neceſſary to his Salvation. Which they ſometime comprehend in fewer words; but never add any one article, beyond thoſe in the Creed.</p>

                        <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (which the Roman Church calls the the VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> General Council) began to talk of the <hi>Regulae Patrum,</hi> the Rules of the Fathers (in ſtead of the ancient word <hi>Regula fidei,</hi> the Rule of Faith, which is the Apoſtles Creed) and called them the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Oracles.</hi> And therefore profeſſed not only to <hi>hold all that the Catholique Church received from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the General Councils: but from any Father or great Doctor in the Church.</hi> Which was the ready way to change the Faith of the Church; and to turn par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mens Opinions, into matter of common belief: though no new Article was as yet put into the ancient Creed.</p>

                     <p>It will be fit I think to ſet down this <hi>New</hi> Creed; that the Reader may compare it, with thoſe I have ſhown were hitherto the intire Faith of the Catholique Church.

                     <p>And every Reader, I ſuppoſe, diſcerns that this is not meerly a confeſſion of Faith, but likewiſe a ſolemn Oath.

                        </note>, (ſo the words are) they could find none to profeſs, but the <hi>Nicene Creed;</hi> no larger Creed was in uſe; no not there, in the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> but theſe very Men who afterward turned <hi>New Creed-makers,</hi> were forced to be content with that.</p>
                     <p>And therefore this <hi>new Profeſſion,</hi> is moſt impudently pretended to be the <hi>true Catholique Faith:</hi> being in no ſenſe Catholique, neither as to place, nor time.

                     <p>Which is direct contradiction to their new Creed, which they make <hi>neceſſary to Salvation:</hi> but can never ſhow to be contained
<hi>implicitely</hi> in the old. For it is as impoſſible to draw Water out of a Pumice, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract out of the Apoſtles Creed, the Doctrine of
<hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, Worſhipping of Images, Seven Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>Traditions and other Conſtitutions</hi> uſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.

                     <p>Nor had that Synod, if theſe Articles could have been ſhown to be contained in the old Creed, any power to explain it, and declare them (according to what they confeſſed at the <hi>Florentine</hi> Council) being far from a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council; no, not of theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts of the World.</p>
                     <p>And clearly ſhowed it ſelf to be but a factious Party in the Church, by that very Explication which they made of this Article, the
<hi>holy Catholique Church:</hi> which they thus expound, <hi>the holy Catholique, Apoſtolique</hi> Roman <hi>Church, the Mother and Miſtreſs of all Churches.</hi> For it is certain the Apoſtles could not intend the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould be comprehended under the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church, any more than every other Church, which was then, or ſhould be hereafter; becauſe it was not in being: there was no <hi>Roman</hi> Church at all, when notwithſtanding, the Church was <hi>Catholique.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hereby Salvation is impiouſly confined to the

                        </note> proves from hence, becauſe neither Scripture nor Tradition affirm it. Nay, if Chriſt had bidden <hi>Peter</hi> to place his See at <hi>Rome,</hi> he doth not think it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he placed it there immoveably. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Man, according to their own ſenſe, is bound to believe the
<hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Church cannot be ſeparated from the <hi>Roman;</hi> which if it ſhould happen, and the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick See be removed, ſuppoſe to <hi>Paris;</hi> the Creed muſt be altered again, and it muſt run thus:
<hi>I believe the holy Catholique and Apoſtolique Pariſian Church, the Mother and Miſtreſs of all Churches.</hi>

                     <p>In which latter part of the Expoſition to this Article, they force Men to ſwear to a downright falſhood. For if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be the <hi>Mother</hi> of all Churches, ſhe muſt be the Mother of her Grand-mother, the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And it is no truer that ſhe is the <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of all Churches: For all Churches were not taught the Faith by her; nor do they own her Authority over them.</p>
                     <p>But it is time to draw to an end of this matter.</p>
                     <p>We in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> have always profeſſed and preſerved a true reverence to the IV. firſt General Councils.

                        <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed: which old Creed, it is madneſs (as the
<hi>Greeks</hi> at <hi>Florence</hi> ſaid) to think inſufficient. For it is to think they were all damned for 1500 Years and more, who knew nothing beyond this, neceſſary to be believed: which no Man in his wits can believe.</p>
                     <p>For it is contrary to the very Faith it ſelf; which teaches us, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>to believe this in the firſt place, that there is nothing to be believed beyond this.</hi> And we believe ſo, with the greateſt reaſon, becauſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any other Articles of Faith, is to make endleſs <hi>Schiſms</hi> in the Church; as to believe contrary Articles, is to fall into dangerous <hi>Hereſies.</hi> We know not where to ſtay, if we reſt not here: for by the ſame Authority, that made theſe, more additions may be made continually, without end.</p>
                     <p>There is therefore no ſuch Authority in the Church, that can do this: but that Church which pretends to it, hath thereby forfeited the Authority, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it might have had.

                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:62912:27"/>
                     <p>Which is a plain Confeſſion, that this was the Faith
<hi>of all Chriſtians,</hi> and no more, till that time; that it was the
<hi>Only firm Foundation;</hi> that which was <hi>read in all Churches;</hi> in which <hi>all agree; the Shield</hi> againſt all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies; the whole Faith then <hi>uſed in the Roman Church.</hi> And therefore with what Conſcience could they make ſuch a diviſion, and miſerable deſtruction, in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, as they have done; by a vaſt number of new Articles, in which all Chriſtians neither do, nor can agree; and which were not to be found in their own Creed before?</p>
                     <p>No reaſon can be given of this, but the immenſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of that Church, to give Law to all others. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we cannot with a good Conſcience ſubmit: eſpecially when they impoſe ſuch a heavy Yoke, as this belief. Which is the true <hi>Makebate</hi> between them and us; the manifeſt cauſe of that fearful Schiſm, which they, not we, have made, by altering the true <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> Faith, and Church, and Communion into a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the true diſtinction between them and us. We are
<hi>Catholiques;</hi> they are <hi>Romans.</hi> We believe the <hi>Catholique Faith</hi> of all Chriſtians; they (as diſtinguiſht from us) believe the

                     <p>For the <hi>Truth</hi> I have ſhown, which ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the Church, in nothing elſe but thoſe <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted myſteries of godlineſs,</hi> contained in the Apoſtles Creed: which I have proved to be the <hi>only Catholique Doctrines,</hi> embraced by all Churches whatſoever.

                     <p>There are particular Men, and ſome ſmall companies of them, here and there, who underſtand ſome few of theſe Doctrines otherwiſe than they ought; but there is no national Church, of any Country, but entertains all theſe intirely and ſincerly, as they have been expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the beginning, according to the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> (which by the way, is the only Creed the <hi>Abaſſines</hi> have, that Creed called the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> being not found among them<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ludolph.

                     <p>In ſome ſenſe, it is true, there is nothing revealed in Holy Scripture, but it may be called fundamental; if we reſpect only the divine Authority, by which it comes unto us: upon which account nothing there delivered may be denyed, but ought to be believed, with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when the knowledge of it is offered to us. But if we reſpect the matter and moment of all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, we cannot but ſee there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and that the knowledge of every thing there is not equally neceſſary, but we may be truly pious though we ſhould be ignorant of ſome of them. For who can think, for inſtance, that it is of the ſame neceſſity, to be able to give an account of the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (mentioned I. <hi>Matth.</hi> III. <hi>Luke</hi>) and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is the <hi>Son of God, made fleſh</hi> for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
                     <p>That <hi>foundation</hi> therefore which was laid in every Church (as it was at <hi>Corinth</hi> 1 III. 11.) were ſuch Doctrines concerning <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as every Chriſtian was bound to learn, and actually believe: in other points it ſufficed, if they had a pious preparation of mind to learn and believe any thing revealed in the Scriptures, when it was ſufficiently cleared to them.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe <hi>two</hi> things, that there are ſuch
<hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> truths, or <hi>firſt principles,</hi> and that they are no other than thoſe contained in the <hi>Creed;</hi> ought to be aſſerted and maintained for the honour and glory of God our Saviour: which is much concerned herein. For it tends much to the glory of the Almighty lover of Souls, that it ſhould be believed he doth not lay equall weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all truths, nor made them alike neceſſary to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for the obtaining his favour and grace: and that it <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62912:29"/>ſhould be certainly known, and be without Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and queſtion, what thoſe truths are, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects ſhould be received and heartily embraced, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Salvation. For otherwiſe, the moſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people muſt neceſſarily periſh: who either are not capable of knowing more than theſe great things, or have not the means of knowing more, or not with any certainty: but muſt be content to reſt here. As well they may; for why was the Creed called by the name of the <hi>Symbol</hi> of Faith, but becauſe it was the mark, or ſign, which might ſerve to diſtinguiſh <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> who embraced it, from <hi>Infidels,</hi> or
<hi>misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> who did not receive it, or were defective in it?</p>
                     <p>This is the true reaſon of the name of <hi>Symbol</hi> which is as much as <hi>teſſera &amp; ſignaculum, quo inter fideles &amp; perſid s ſecernitur</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Maximus Taur. de Trad.

                     <p>But ſo it was, that they who owned this Creed, were owned for Chriſtians; they who did not confeſs it, were rejected: for by a Man's anſwer to this, who was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, he was diſcovered (juſt as a Soldier is by the <hi>Word</hi>) <hi>ſi hoſtis ſit, an ſocius</hi> (as both

<hi>Roman</hi> Church, by an undoubted <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> and
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical cuſtom and practice:</hi> which continues in all other Churches to this day.</p>
                     <p>Which obſervation evidently convinces them to be guilty of the moſt fearful ſin, in curſing and damning thoſe, who do not receive theſe <hi>Novel</hi> Doctrines: though they faithfully embrace all the Doctrines of the truly Catholique Faith; and had rather die than deny any part thereof.</p>
                     <p>But let us be of good comfort; we are ſafe enough, notwithſtanding all theſe <hi>Anathema's,</hi> which they thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out againſt us: For I have proved, that were theſe Doctrines true, as they are certainly falſe, which they preſs upon us; yet we ſhould not be
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> if we did not believe them; and ſo not fall, upon this account, under the ſentence of damnation. Becauſe it is only the denial of the great and fundamental Truths, that can <pb n="55" facs="tcp:62912:33"/>make us incur ſuch a danger: other Truths there are of which we may be ignorant, without danger of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; provided we ſtill hold the Foundation, and <hi>keep the Faith,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, with a life according to it.</p>
                     <p>They themſelves therefore knew that theſe terrible
<hi>Anathema's,</hi> are but <hi>bugbear</hi> words, which they uſe to affright Children withal: For they who can read what the wiſeſt and beſt of them write, will find that they confeſs, theſe new Articles to be ſuperfluous; while they plainly ſay the Apoſtles Creed contains all things neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Valentia</hi>

<hi>The Articles of Faith contained in the Creed, are as it were the firſt Principles of Chriſtian Faith — in which are comprized the ſumm of Evangelical Doctrine, which all are bound explicitely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. — Thus the Fathers judge when they affirm this Creed was compoſed by the Apoſtles, that all might have a ſhort Summary of thoſe things which are to be believed, and are ſcatteredly contained in the Scriptures.</hi> Thus alſo writes <hi>Filiucius</hi> and a great many more: even the <hi>Trent Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> it ſelf, as I have ſhown before. So that we have nothing to do; but to <hi>hold faſt</hi> that which we have been taught from the beginning, and to make it the Rule of our Lives, as well as of our Faith.</p>
                     <p>And that now, I muſt tell you, for a Concluſion of this part of my Diſcourſe, is the Grand Truth of all; the main point of the Chriſtian belief: that <hi>the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Divine Truths, and of Faith it ſelf, is to make us truly godly.</hi> They can do us no ſervice, if they do not produce this effect.</p>
                     <p>Whence it is that in this very Epiſtle of S.
<hi>Paul,</hi> he calls Chriſtianity <hi>the Doctrine that is according unto god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> VI. 3. and a little after, calls it
<hi>godlineſs,</hi> v. 6. <hi>But Godlineſs,</hi> that is the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>with <pb n="56" facs="tcp:62912:34"/>contentment is great gain.</hi> And indeed we may well be contented, with the Chriſtian Faith and Hope, and think our ſelves happy in ſuch glorious expectations hereafter: nay look upon our ſelves, as exceeding great gainers, whatſoever we loſe here upon this account, if we loſe not the hope of immortal life.</p>
                     <p>In the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> alſo, in the very firſt Verſe, he calls it <hi>the truth which is after godlineſs:</hi> which is the very Truth, that is the ſubject of my Diſcourſe; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what follows, when the Apoſtle ſaith it is <hi>a myſtery of godlineſs.</hi> Not a cunning device to get Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to advance our wordly Grandeur and Pomp; much leſs a crafty Artifice to excuſe us from living well, or to palliate wickedneſs, and ſhow us a way, how to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved though we live ungodly (which is the great drift of too many Doctrines, wherewith the World is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled) but a wonderful contrivance of the Wiſdom of Heaven, effectually to root out all Impiety, to plant all manner of Vertue in our Hearts; and to take all kind of excuſe from us, if we do not become truly good.</p>
                     <p>Whence it is that the Apoſtle deſcribes Chriſtian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in this Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> II. 10. by this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that
<hi>they profeſs godlineſs. Let them be adorned,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as becomes women profeſſing godlineſs, with good works.</hi> Not meerly profeſſing the <hi>Truth,</hi> or the <hi>Faith,</hi> but
<hi>Godlineſs;</hi> which comprehends all Chriſtian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: though if he had ſaid, profeſſing the Truth, it had been of the ſame import; becauſe <hi>that truth, is godlineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence all the Truths I have mentioned, are called

<hi>deceived</hi> by our own, or others <hi>luſts</hi>) that is, in the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: it is that which teaches us to abandon all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and not to think of throwing a covering over it to hide it, but to put it off: that which renews us in the very ſpirit of our minds; which makes us new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and really reſtores the Divine Image in us, in Rightouſneſs and ſincere Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have learned Chriſt, thus we are conſtantly taught, in this Church: And therefore,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Truth hath not this effect upon us, in vain do we pride our ſelves in the name of <hi>Orthodox belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> Upon ſuch S. <hi>John</hi> hath paſſed this cenſure, 1 I. 6. <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62912:35"/>lye, and do not the truth.</hi> Where you may obſerve, by the way, there is a <hi>doing of the truth</hi> expected from us, and not meerly <hi>believing</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>It was expected from the very Heathen, proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what they knew: for they are accuſed by S. <hi>Paul</hi> upon this ſcore, that <hi>they held the Truth of God in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> I.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 18. Some Truth they knew, and it taught them to do better than they did: and their not doing ſo, was their condemnation. And if natural Truth, taught them <hi>righteouſneſs of life,</hi> much more doth this Divine Revelation which God hath made in Chriſt Jeſus, inſtruct us therein: and if they were found guilty for holding <hi>that</hi> Truth in unrighteouſneſs, much more ſhall we be found ſo for holding, in the like wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, theſe <hi>ſupernatural</hi> Truths; which we know on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a ſpecial Grace of God; which hath revealed them unto us for this very purpoſe, to <hi>teach us, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ungodlineſs and all worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world,</hi> 2 Tit. II. 12.</p>
                     <p>Which if we do not, mark the conſequence: either we ſhall not <hi>hold the Truth;</hi> or if we do, the Truth will not ſave us, but only ſerve to condemn us.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes by living wickedly Men loſe the very Truth, either in whole, or in part: as the Heathen, S. <hi>Paul</hi> there ſhows, did, I. <hi>Rom.</hi> 21, 22, 23. Read the words, and you will not wonder if the ſame ſad fate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Mens Impiety now: which the Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſo directly oppoſe; that if they cannot prevail with Men to leave their wickedneſs, their wickedneſs will prevail with them to leave the Truth.</p>
                     <p>This belief, for inſtance, that Jeſus Chriſt, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, who died for us, and roſe again, will come to judge us (which is the ſumm of Chriſtianity) is ſo manifeſtly againſt thoſe ſins which Men commit againſt his Laws, that, if they be perſwaded they ſhall <pb n="59" facs="tcp:62912:35"/>be judged according to his Goſpel, it muſt needs make them very uneaſie in their ſins. Which therefore if they will not quit, their ſins will tempt them to be rid of this belief; which diſquiets and diſturbs them in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Luſts, on which they have ſet their Heart.</p>
                     <p>Or if it have not this effect, to make them wholly disbelieve, the life and judgment to come, yet it tempts them to adulterate the Chriſtian Faith (as too many Chriſtians have done) and to deviſe eaſier terms of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs than the Goſpel propounds: inventing ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as will favour them in their ſins, and comply with their inclinations to follow their foul Luſts, and yet not periſh eternally. And it is not hard to ſhow, if this were a proper place for it, that abundance of falſe noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if not all, which Men have about <hi>Faith,</hi> have ſprung from this cauſe.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe Men do ſtill hold the Truth, though in unrighteouſneſs, what will they get by it? ſince it will not ſave them, but only ſerve to condemn them. For this is a part of the Evangelical Truth, as you read in the place now named. (I. <hi>Rom.</hi> 18.) that <hi>the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> And again we read in the next Chapter of <hi>the righteous judgment of God, who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who by patient continuance in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life: But unto them that are contentious,</hi> (or will not yield to evident convictions) <hi>and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh, upon every ſoul of man that doth evil,</hi> &amp;c. v. 6, 7, 8, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Where you ſee there is an <hi>obedience to the truth,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from us: unto which if we will not ſubmit, but <pb n="60" facs="tcp:62912:36"/>
                        <hi>obey unrighteouſneſs;</hi> then that very Truth tells us we muſt expect nothing, but the inexpreſſible diſpleaſure of the Almighty, againſt every ſuch refractory oppoſer of the Truth, which he ſhould obey. There is no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from this Rule; for (as it there follows,
<hi>v.</hi> 11.) <hi>there is no reſpect of perſons with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Would to God they would ſeriouſly lay this to heart, who now ſeem to be poſſeſſed with a mighty Zeal for <hi>Truth,</hi> and for a <hi>right Faith:</hi> that they be not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by this warm Zeal, as to miſs the <hi>end of Faith, the Salvation of their Souls;</hi> which can by no means be obtained, no not by Faith it ſelf, without an Holy Life.</p>

<hi>ſupporters</hi> and <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,</hi> without which the edifice would fall to the ground. And the moſt we can make of them when they are applied to the <hi>Church,</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>truth,</hi> is this; that the Church ſuſtains and keeps it from ſinking, or falling, as a Pillar firmly ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Baſis,</hi> ſuſtains and upholds the fabrick laid upon it. This conſiſts in theſe three things, which I ſhall diſtinctly, though but briefly, mention: for the Reader's clear information in this matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Church is that Body of Men, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and keeps, which maintains and holds up the Chriſtian Faith: which God hath committed to its care, as he did to the <hi>Jews</hi> the Divine Oracles, delivered in old times. And as the Church will anſwer it to God, and not be guilty of betraying its truſt, it muſt conſtantly preſerve the truth committed to it; that it be not loſt and do not periſh. This might be divided into <hi>two,</hi> that the Church is the keeper and Conſervator of all the Holy Scriptures, and the Divine Truths contained therein: and that by faithful keeping them, it upholds and ſupports the Truth, as a Pillar doth the building which reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. But this is ſufficiently included in what follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Church is not only to preſerve the Truth, but to profeſs it, and to give atteſtation to it: that is, to bear witneſs that this is the Truth of God, and this alone, which he hath revealed for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind. By which means it doth not only <hi>hold up</hi> the Truth, but <hi>hold it out</hi> to others; as the Sacred Edict or Decree of God; which all are to take notice of and obſerve. And ſo,</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62912:38"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is by this means to promote and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the <hi>Truth,</hi> and not let it fall to the ground: as a building doth, when the Pillars, that ſupported it, are removed.</p>
                  <p>In brief; As Heretical Churches were the Pillars and Stays of falſhood; they maintained and defended it, they teſtified to it, and indeavour'd to continue it, and leave it to Poſterity: juſt ſo is the Church of Chriſt, the Pillar and Ground of <hi>Truth;</hi> it profeſſes the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, it maintains it as the Truth of God; and notwithſtanding all the perſecutions, troubles, loſſes, torments, whereby its Enemies would ſhake the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of thoſe who maintain the Truth, they teſtifie to it, and declare to future Generations, that
<hi>this,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>is the true grace of God, wherein we ſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the firſt conſideration, to aſſure us of the true meaning of theſe words.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <p n="2">II. The <hi>Second,</hi> is as ſtrong; for plain reaſon makes it evident, that this, not the other, is the ſenſe of them. The Church, that is, cannot be the very foundation upon which the Truth is built, not that which gives it authority, and makes it to be Truth: for the quite contrary is declared by <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf; that the Truth is the foundation upon which the Church is built, and which makes it to be a
<hi>Church.</hi> So S. <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructs this very Church of
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> who were <hi>built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner Stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth into an holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Lord: In whom ye alſo are builded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for an habitation of God through the Spirit,</hi> II. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 18, 19, 20. It was therefore a Church of Chriſt, becauſe it held the Truth, which He and his Apoſtles
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62912:39"/>taught. And ſo a great number of the Ancient Fathers expound thoſe words of Chriſt to S. <hi>Peter, Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock; i. e.</hi> upon the confeſſion of Faith which thou haſt made, upon that Truth thou haſt confeſt, <hi>I will build my Church.</hi> Matth. XVI.</p>
                  <p>We can own no Society of Men to be a Church of Chriſt, unleſs they profeſs the true Faith of Chriſt. And therefore the true Faith muſt be known before we can know whether they be a true Church or no, who call themſelves by that Name: and conſequently they do not give authority to the Truth, but the Truth to them; becauſe the Truth muſt be ſuppoſed, before they can have any authority.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve the above recited words I beſeech you; which ſay, the Church is built upon <hi>the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by them in the Goſpel. It is a Church by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing this: for if this be not the thing which makes a company of Men to be <hi>a Church of the living God;</hi> tell me, why the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are not his Church? They are a ſociety of Men profeſſing ſome belief, and having ſome truth and devotion, and being governed by Laws as well as we. There is no reaſon why they belong not to the Church of Chriſt, but becauſe they have not <hi>the Truth as it is in Chriſt.</hi> Therefore the Church doth not make the Truth; but the Truth makes the Church: the Truth doth not rely upon the Church, becauſe it is before the Church, which relies upon it.</p>
                  <p>Which was the Doctrine of the Church it ſelf in after Ages; as it were eaſie to ſhew, if I intended to write a great Book. I will content my ſelf with two Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in ancient times, the one is of S.
<hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who thus expounds theſe very words, <hi>the Church of the living God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi> Not like that Judaical Temple: (ſaith he) for this is it, which <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62912:39"/>keeps together and contains the Faith and the preaching (or Doctrine) <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.
<hi>For the Truth is both the Pillar and the Ground, or foundation of the Church:</hi> The other is S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his third Book upon the

                  <p>They endeavour indeed to put by ſuch evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction as this, by a little diſtinction; that though in <hi>it ſelf</hi> the Church is built upon the Truth, yet in <hi>reſpect to us</hi> the Truth is built upon the Church. Which appears already to be a vain conceit, unto thoſe who conſider; that the Church cannot be the foundation of Truth to us, unleſs we firſt know it to be the true Church of Chriſt; and indued with this priviledge from God to be <hi>the Ground of Truth;</hi> in this ſenſe which I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing. But whence ſhould we know this? If it be ſaid,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62912:40"/>from the Truth which it profeſſes; then the Church is not the Foundation of the Truth to us, for we muſt know the Truth, before we can know that to be the true Church, which calls it ſelf the Foundation. If we ſay from the Church; then the Church is the <hi>Pillar and Ground</hi> of it ſelf; and we believe it to be the true Church, becauſe it ſays it is. Which is ſo abſurd and dangerous, that the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as I ſaid, will be as true a Church as any elſe: they may boldly put in for their ſhare of this priviledge: Nay, if confidence, and power can carry it, ingroſs it wholly to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It remains therefore that this is the true ſenſe of the words which I have given. The Church keeps the Truth, and keeps it up: It is the Conſervator of it, and preſerves it from falling to the ground: it proclaims it, and holds it forth to others: it continues the truth in the World, and ſettles it in mens minds: but it ſelf is built upon this Truth, not the Truth upon it. Which derives its authority from God, who ſent Jeſus Chriſt into the World to teach us his will, and gave him power to ſend his Apoſtles, as he had ſent him: <hi>God bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them witneſs, with ſigns and wonders, and with divers mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This will be the more plainly laid open, if I ſpend a little time, in ſhowing what is here meant by <hi>the Church,</hi> which is commonly thought to be <hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth;</hi> and was the
<hi>third</hi> thing propounded in the beginning to be explained.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> ſignifies every where a company of Chriſtians united under their Paſtors, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt their Head, by a ſincere Faith; and joyned one to another by Brotherly love and communion. <pb n="69" facs="tcp:62912:40"/>Where ever we find ſuch a Society of Men and Women, there is a Church: and all the Societies of this kind, throughout the World, make up that which we call the <hi>Catholique,</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Church; the whole body of Chriſt, or Chriſtian Church. Of which the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> here ſpoken of was a part: one eminent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Chriſtians profeſſing the truly
<hi>Catholique</hi> Faith, and joyned to <hi>Timothy</hi> as their chief Paſtor, for the worſhip and ſervice of Chriſt; and for to <hi>be the Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> as theſe words muſt be interpreted, if they relate unto the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They indeed, who are now of the Roman Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, underſtand by the <hi>Church,</hi> only the Paſtors of the Church. And ſome of them, this <hi>Church repreſentative,</hi> as it may be called; that is, the whole aſſembly of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Biſhops, as many as can meet together, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Churches under their care. But others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand only one Biſhop alone, the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> who is then the <hi>Church Virtual,</hi> in whom all the power of all the Biſhops in the World is united. But as there are no ſuch notions of the Word <hi>Church</hi> in Scripture; ſo, if they be applied to this place, they will appear very wild fancies, unto any Man who will ſoberly conſider the ſcope of it. For it is very evident, that <hi>the Church</hi> is here mentioned as diſtinct from
<hi>Timothy,</hi> who was the prime Paſtor of it, and who is directed how to behave himſelf in it. Therefore if this Church was <hi>the Pillar of Truth,</hi> the whole multitude of Believers at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under him and the reſt of their Paſtors, muſt be lookt upon as having an intereſt in this great priviledge and honour, as well as duty, to be the Conſervators and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the Chriſtian Faith, which they had received. For S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as I ſaid, is inſtructing <hi>Timothy</hi> how to demean himſelf, in this Society, which he calls the <hi>Houſe</hi> or family of God: that is, among true Believers <pb n="70" facs="tcp:62912:41"/>in Chriſt, formed into a Society under the Government of their Guides: who were to take the greater care, that every one in the Church was well taught, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and ordered, becauſe they were <hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This made S. <hi>Paul</hi> very ſolicitous, that
<hi>Timothy</hi> ſhould carry himſelf well, and be a good Paſtor in that Church, of which the Holy Ghoſt had made him chief Overſeer. And not knowing when he might have opportunity to ſee him, and give him perſonal inſtruction by word of mouth, he wrote this Letter to him for his direction; that he might fully underſtand how to diſcharge this Office. And therefore theſe words, it appears by the verſe foregoing (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) relate partly to what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and partly to what follows. <hi>Theſe things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee ſhortly: but if I tarry long, that thou mayeſt know how thou oughteſt to behave thy ſelf in the Houſe of God, which is the Church of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth. And without controverſie, great is the myſtery of godlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. Which whole Paragraph is to be underſtood as if he had ſaid, in more words.
<q rend="margQuotes">Though I hope ſhortly to diſcourſe with thee face to face, yet not knowing what may hinder and retard my hopes, I have ſent the above written inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to thee; not to trouble the Church with vain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, about the rites of the Law, and ſuch idle queſtions as the <hi>Jews</hi> are apt to raiſe: but, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (as I have ſaid in the beginning of this Letter <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. of the firſt Chapter) that <hi>the end of the Commandment is charity,</hi> the love of God and of our neighbour. This therefore teach them; and inſtruct them alſo to make <hi>prayers, ſupplications and interceſſion, with giving of thanks for all Men: for Kings, and all that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> (Chap. II. 1, 2, 3, 4.) teach them all likewiſe how to pray (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) and inſtruct the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and the <pb n="71" facs="tcp:62912:41"/>
                        <hi>Deacons</hi> and all the reſt in their Office and Duty: for it is of great concernment, that they be well informed; becauſe this Church, over which thou art ſet, is the very <hi>Seat of Truth,</hi> which is not to be found in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, but in ſuch a company of Believers. Who ought to uphold and defend it, when thou art dead and gone; and therefore had need be well ſetled and eſtabliſhed in it: eſpecially in the great myſtery of godlineſs, wherein all Chriſtians agree, and about which there is no Controverſie. That ſo the Church may never let it go, and this Truth may not dye and fall to the Ground, when we are laid in our Graves; but be delivered to thoſe that come after, as the very Oracles of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who now is there ſo blind, as not to be able to ſee, that by <hi>the Church</hi> is meant, not merely the ſupream Governour of the Church, which was <hi>Timothy;</hi> but all that company of Chriſtian people, under their ſeveral Biſhops and Teachers, who belonged to
<hi>Epheſus.</hi> All of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Timothy,</hi> when he himſelf went into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to take care of, and to charge that they <hi>taught no other Doctrine</hi> (as you read, 1.3.) and in this
<hi>Houſe,</hi> or Family he was, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle to him; not in a <hi>General Council,</hi> for there was none, in three hundred Year after this time. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not ſpeak of the <hi>Church Repreſentative,</hi> as it is called; much leſs of the <hi>Church Virtual,</hi> as they term it; that is, the Pope. For then, mark what ſence the words will make; <hi>I have wrote to thee</hi> (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when I ſhall ſee thee) how to <hi>behave thy ſelf in the Biſhop of</hi> Rome: as if he would have us fancy <hi>Timothy</hi> in the Popes Belly; and himſelf gravely inſtructing him, how to carry himſelf with great circumſpection and diſcretion there.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:62912:42"/>
                  <p>I do not love to uſe ſuch words; but there are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I can find ſo apt to repreſent the groſs abſurdity of their Doctrines, who take upon them to give infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interpretations of Holy Scripture, from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop, the grand and only Oracle of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as they would have him eſteemed: or from ſuch Councils as they are pleaſed to call General, and can obtain their approbation. You ſee what godly ones we are like to have, if we give up our Faith to them: how they will pervert the plain words of God, to ſerve their own intereſt; and wreſt them from their natural and eaſie ſence, to another which is ſo forced, that there is no Man ſo rude but would readily diſcern the abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, if he were permitted to read, and did conſider, the Holy Scripture. For their great Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledges theſe very words to prove that

<hi>6.</hi> Denique.</note>: where it is evident to the weakeſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that the whole company of Chriſtians, that were at
<hi>Epheſus</hi> united to their Paſtors (without which they could not be a Society or Company) are the Church here ſpoken of: and therefore are the
<hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> (if this relate to the Church) and not merely ſome particular perſon in that Church: much leſs a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council of all the Biſhops in the World; and leaſt of all, one Biſhop; in whom <hi>Timothy</hi> could not be ſaid, in any ſenſe, to be; as he is here ſaid to be in that Church, which is the <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth, viz.</hi> in that Church whereof he was the chief Governour: which was the
<hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth</hi> in that part of the World. For this is not an Office appropriated to any particular Church, but belonging to the Catholique Church, and to every ſingle Church, as it is a Member of the Whole.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62912:42"/>
                  <p>And here it will be very profitable, I think, to note theſe ſix things, for the full explication of this place of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The firſt of them is that which I now mentioned; that every particular Church, one as well, and as much as another, is a
<hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth;</hi> in that ſenſe which I have declared. This is not a prerogative which belongs to ſome one Church; but a priviledge, appertaining to the Univerſal; and to every particular, as a part of it. For if the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> was a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Truth, as S.
<hi>Paul</hi> here affirms; then by the ſame reaſon, the Church of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had the ſame authority. For that which made any one of them a Church, made the other ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> the true Faith of Chriſt there profeſſed, and union with their Paſtors, for the Divine ſervice: and therefore that honour or Office, which belong'd to one of them, muſt of neceſſity belong to another; becauſe they were but ſo many members of one and the ſame Body. That is, every one of them, in their ſeveral Countries, wherein they were planted, had the truth of God committed to them; which they were to maintain and ſupport unto the very death: and endeavour that every one, who was a Stranger to the <hi>words of eternal life,</hi> might by their means know and believe them.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly every Church hath contributed unto this, and no one Church, could ever with any reaſon pretend to be the ſole ſupporter or defender of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Truth. Of which there is this plain demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that then the Church is moſt of all the <hi>Pillar and Ground,</hi> or Buttreſs, as ſome tranſlate it, <hi>of Truth,</hi> when it is aſſaulted by Hereſies; and not only beats them off, but beats them down and ſuppreſſes them. Now all Hereſies were not quaſht and confounded by S. <hi>Peter</hi> 
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:62912:43"/>and his Succeſſors in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but by other Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and their Succeſſors in other Churches. This is demonſtrated by a learned Man, of the Roman Communion<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. Launoii Epiſt. pars Quinta Antonio Varillao p. <hi>35. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>, by XII. famous inſtances, out of a far greater number. S. <hi>John</hi> for example, not

<hi>Ptolemaites,</hi> the <hi>Noetians,</hi> and divers other Hereticks: as the Synod of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> did. <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi>

                  <p>The like may be ſaid of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who, when they ſuffered in great numbers, gave the more ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing teſtimony to the Truth, which terrified the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf, and ſtaggered their very Judges: as S.
<hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks<note n="(k)" place="margin">Tom. <hi>1.</hi> Hom.
<hi>XX.</hi>
                     </note> of the XL <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who all together, as if they had had but one Mouth, cryed out, when they were examined, <hi>I am a Chriſtian.</hi> By ſuch reſolution as this our Religion was not only upheld, but mightily increaſed: And the more the number of Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the more was Truth ſpread abroad, till it grew to be the prevailing Religion; and the <hi>Kingdoms of <pb n="84" facs="tcp:62912:48"/>the World became the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it was not mere numbers that did the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for their extraordinary Piety and Purity in thoſe early days, had the greateſt hand in it. Which was the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing I deſired to be noted under this laſt head, that the <hi>better</hi> the Paſtors and the People are, the greater ſervice they do to the Truth; and the more prevalent their teſtimony is, when it appears by their lives, that they have no other intereſt to ſerve, but that of Truth and Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>And when all is done, it will be found that the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of thoſe who aſſert God's holy Truth, their pure and undefiled Religion which keeps them from being <hi>ſpotted by the World,</hi> is that which will be the moſt powerful to move Mens minds, and will make the eaſieſt way for its entertainment in Mens Hearts. Nothing can give a <hi>Church</hi> ſuch authority, and make its teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſo credible, as its integrity and ſincere Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; its ſtudy of purity in Heart and Life; its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning clearly the good of Souls, and not worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; its univerſal charity and kindneſs: which invites even ſtrangers to attend unto it, and much more its own Members.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I muſt note for a concluſion of this part of my Diſcourſe, that when we ſpeak of <hi>the Church,</hi> i. e. the whole company of believers, and ſay that it is <hi>the Pillar and Ground or eſtabliſhment of Truth,</hi> it is meant <hi>principally</hi> of thoſe, whoſe Faith brings forth fruit and works by love. Theſe are the main ſupporters of the Chriſtian Religion; who do not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs it; but are acted and live by their Faith, in all holy obedience to Chriſt. For they are <hi>living Stones</hi> built upon him the foundation of all; the true living <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> who are animated by his Spirit,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62912:48"/>and with whom he hath promiſed to <hi>make his abode:</hi> and conſequently are the only perſons, who to purpoſe ſupport and maintain, and defend the Truth. Which would in a little time, be ſuppreſſed or obſcured, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved or varied, concealed or miſinterpreted; if the wicked only had the conduct of it. Who are no more to be accounted <hi>Pillars of the Truth, i. e.</hi> can no more alone ſupport and uphold it, than a Reed, a Straw or a rotten Stick, can ſupport a building. This is the ancient Doctrine of the Church it ſelf, as appears by what S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſaies, in his Preface to the Expoſition of the XLVIII. <hi>Pſalm</hi>
                     <note n="(k)" place="margin">Tom. <hi>VIII.</hi> Enarratio in <hi>Pſal. XLVII.</hi>
                     </note> . Where taking the
<hi>firmament,</hi> which was made the ſecond day, to be an emblem of the
<hi>Church,</hi> he ſaith by the <hi>Church</hi> we ought to underſtand
<hi>Eccleſiam Chriſti in Sanctis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Church of Chriſt in his Saints; the Church of Chriſt in thoſe whoſe names are written in Heaven, the Church of Chriſt in thoſe who do not yield to the temptations of this World. Ipſi enim digni ſunt nomine FIRMAMENTI,</hi> for theſe are
<hi>worthy the name of Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or ſtrength. Therefore the Church of Chriſt in thoſe <hi>qui firmi ſunt,</hi> who <hi>are ſtrong (concerning whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, we that are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak) is called the FIRMAMENT. For hearken and acknowledge, how this Church is called by this name in the Apoſtolical writings</hi> (and then he quotes this place to <hi>Timothy</hi>) <hi>which is the Church of the living God, columna &amp; firmamentum veritatis, the Pillar and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe principally the Truth is maintained: For it is moſt plainly delivered by the Apoſtles themſelves, that Men and Women, by their wicked lives, did turn Apoſtates from the Faith. And we find by experience, as well as their inſtructions, that nothing doth more quench the Spirit of God, nothing is more contrary to true Wiſdom, than filthineſs and impurity, which we <pb n="86" facs="tcp:62912:49"/>muſt abandon therefore, and not think we can do very conſiderable ſervice to the Truth, by the bare profeſſion of it: but upon the foundation Chriſt Jeſus, we muſt ſeriouſly indeavour to raiſe the ſuperſtructure of a holy life, whereby we ſhall adorn, recommend, and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promote our Religion.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be denyed indeed, that a multitude profeſſing true Faith in Chriſt, though their lives be not ſo regular as they ought to be, are not unſerviceable to our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Nay, in ſome caſes, by their ſteadineſs in the Truth, give no ſmall ſupport unto it. Eſpecially, when they likewiſe continue united together, by partaking conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſame Sacraments. Whereby they are joyned to thoſe who are truly good, and remain a part of the Chriſtian ſociety; till their lives be ſo bad that they are <hi>thrown</hi> out of the Church, as not fit to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with it. And therefore out of ſuch a Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of thoſe that profeſs the Faith of Chriſt intirely, and worſhip him purely, without any dangerous mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, no Man ought to depart; merely becauſe every one therein is not knit to Chriſt by ſuch hearty love and obedience as that Faith ought to produce. For they that are only in outward Communion with ſuch a Church, are in a good way to ſomething more: and therefore ought not to be rejected, as no Chriſtians. For by external Communion, the inward lively Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God our Saviour, is produced, ſet forward, and promoted: and it is ſomething to own Chriſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for our Lord and Maſter; and receive conſtant inſtructions from his Miniſters, whereby we are convinced of our duty. Which though it doth not at preſent make them good and faithful Servants, yet they may be ſo in time: and the way to make them ſo, is not to leave them to themſelves, by ſeparating from them; but to admoniſh, reprove and exhort them <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62912:49"/>to become living Members of Chriſt's Body, that they may do him greater ſervice, by recommending his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion effectually to the World. As all thoſe do, who ſeparate from the wickedneſs of the World, though they continue mixed with the wicked that are in the Church; till they can, in an orderly manner and after regular proceedings, be thrown out of it. Whereas, on the contrary, they who upon pretence of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being mixed with the godly, depart from the external Communion of the Church; have very much diſhonoured Religion, and help to deſtroy the Church by endleſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.</p>
                  <p>For when they have ſo departed from the Church, they are not ſure they depart from the wicked: though it be ſure they have left the Communion of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Men and Women, who are mingled in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, with the bad. And what advantage can ſuch Men propound unto themſelves, or unto true Religion and godlineſs: when they certainly forſake the ſociety of a great many truly good Men, for an imaginary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the wicked? Becauſe after all the care they can take, they cannot be ſure there are no wicked among them: but they leave a Church, in which it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous there are a great number of holy People, and erect Congregations, for ought they can certainly know, of ſuch as conceit themſelves Religious, merely from this ſeparation.</p>
                  <p>This is not the means therefore of upholding Truth, and of promoting godlineſs. But if we be ſeriouſly bent on that, the Apoſtle hath ſhown us the way in the next Epiſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 19. <hi>Let every one that names the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth ſo, he is an excellent Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Truth: which was promoted by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, I might ſay by nothing ſo much, as by the <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62912:50"/>eminent Piety and Vertue of the firſt Preachers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and of the generality of thoſe who were called by Chriſt's name. Some bad people there were among them (as we learn by the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>) which did not unchurch them, nor make them unfit for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them. <hi>For in a great Houſe</hi> (as the Apoſtle there ſpeaks in the next verſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 20, 21.) <hi>there are not only veſſels of Gold and Silver, but alſo of Wood and of Earth; and ſome to honour, ſome to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. But if a Man purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour, ſanctified and meet for his Maſter's uſe, and prepared unto every good work.</hi> Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle writes immediately after theſe words, <hi>Let every one that names the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi> Whatſoever becomes of others, he ſhall become an <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant</hi> of his Maſter Chriſt, <hi>a veſſel of Honour,</hi> or an inſtrument to do him honour, by being
<hi>fitted to every good work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are eminent teſtimonies of this, not only in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian but in Pagan Writers alſo, that hereby the Truth of Chriſt prevailed and got the upper hand in the World. For <hi>Julian</hi>

                  <p>And ſuch an eminent vertue it muſt be, and that alone, which can reſtore our Religion to its primitive luſtre: Nay, that which will preſerve it from being loſt, where it is planted. For as faſt as true piety and vertue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62912:50"/>ſo faſt doth the Church go to ruin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we have an hearty love to our own Church, and the ſaving truth of God, which is there profeſſed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, we muſt ſtudy to uphold it by this means. Not by ſeeking for a purer Church (which is impoſſible, as to Faith and Worſhip, and Manners too, to be found) but by endeavouring to amend one another, by purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves in the firſt place from all filthineſs both of the fleſh, and of ſpirit; and then by admoniſhing others that do not live as they ought, of the error of their ways, and calling them to Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Which courſe I wiſh all they who have ſeparated from our Communion, would conſider whether they ever took? Did they not firſt forſake us, and then ſay, before they tried, that we have people incorrigibly wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us? This is not the way (to ſay nothing of what ſort of people they have among themſelves) of ſaving us all from periſhing: but, as it proceeds commonly from too much pride, and conceitedneſs, and from great want of Charity; ſo it produces lamentable effects. For under a pretence of making the Church more holy, it deſtroys both holineſs and the Church: by breaking the unity of it, by diſgracing Religion, by turning it into diſputes and vain jangling, by endleſs ſeparations under the notion of great and more refined purity; till the Church be crumbled into ſo many little bits and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that little more than the name of a Church remains.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore preſerve Union among our ſelves as much as is poſſible, that we may preſerve the Church and Truth. And then there may be the more hope of reclaiming the ungodly: who will receive an admonition or reproof far better from one of their ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, who calls them brethren; than from one that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates from them as mere Strangers and Foreigners, with whom they have nothing to do in matters of Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:62912:51"/>
                  <p>Would to God this were more ſeriouſly practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; that we would be as forward, charitably to reprove Men for their wickedneſs, as we are even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them, perhaps uncharitably, for their falſe opinions. It might be a means of their cure, an effectual remedy for their amendment, when piouſly and prudently admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred: and a means of bringing thoſe back, who are gone aſtray from us, that there <hi>may be no diviſions among us, but we may be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment.</hi>

               <p>WHAT the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith concerning
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was wont there to aſſemble, is more fully verified in the Chriſtian Church: <hi>Great and glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O thou city of God,</hi> LXXXVII.
<hi>Pſ.</hi> 1. This great City, S. <hi>John</hi> ſaw deſcending out of Heaven, <hi>having the glory of God,</hi> XXI. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10, 11. And in the Verſe before, calls this Church, <hi>the bride, the lambs wife.</hi> There is a ſpecial preſence, that is, of God in it; and a ſpecial love of the Lord Jeſus to it. For it is, <hi>the body of Chriſt, and the fulneſs of him that fills all things.</hi> To this, S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>they ſhall bring the glory and honour of the nations:</hi> againſt this, our Saviour promiſes, <hi>the gates of hell ſhall not prevail. The pure water of life, clear as cryſtal</hi> runs therein: here grows the <hi>tree of life,</hi> (XXII. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1, 2.) and it is, as it were, the <hi>paradiſe and garden of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which things ſhow what an honour, what an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is, to be a Citizen of this Holy <hi>Jeruſalcm.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be, that by a cordial Faith in Chriſt, and ſincere love to him, joyn themſelves to this Body, are made Members of Chriſt, Children of God, Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They are under the protection of the Almighty; <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62912:52"/>under the guidance of his Holy Spirit; under the care and tender love of that great and glorious Lord, who is the
<hi>Prince of all the kings of the earth,</hi> and hath <hi>all power in heaven,</hi> as well as <hi>earth,</hi> inveſted in him. For the Church is the <hi>houſe and family of God,</hi> nay the <hi>temple of the living God,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> VI. 17.) for he hath ſaid, as it there follows,
<hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people: I will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord God Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things are great indeed, and exceeding glorious.</p>
               <p>But not content with theſe priviledges, which are as a Royal Diadem, and Crown of Glory, on the Head of the Church; there are thoſe who would adorn her with prouder Titles: and ſet her forth in an adulterous dreſs, and a preſumptuous glory; making her, in a manner, equal to her Head, the Lord Chriſt. For they have ſnatcht one of the incommunicable properties of God, and fixt it, as a Jewel, on the top of the Churches Crown: telling us that ſhe is an infallible Guide, who cannot miſlead us. That is, though ſhe may go aſtray, and play the Harlot, in life and practice, yet ſhe cannot err, nor miſtake in her judgment: So that if we liſten to what ſhe ſays, we ſhall never wander, but always be in the right.</p>
               <p>For the proof of this, they firſt ſuppoſe themſelves to be the Church of Chriſt, and they alone: and then they abuſe this place of Holy Scripture, to aſſert this Divine Prerogative to be in his Church; that is, in themſelves. But I have expoſed the bold folly of theſe pretences, by ſhowing, that the Church here ſpoken of is the Church of
<hi>Epheſus;</hi> and that <hi>Timothy</hi> was the principal <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth</hi> in this Church. Which doth not ſignifie, I have ſhown, that either the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> were the very Foundation of the Chriſtian Faith, <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62912:52"/>upon whoſe credit the Authority, the Truth, and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all Religion depends: but the Supporters of the Truth; who teſtified, maintained, upheld, and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For the more full underſtanding of which, I ſhall briefly ſhow (before I proceed to the <hi>laſt</hi> thing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
<hi>firſt</hi> what power it is that we herein aſcribe to the Church; particularly to the Biſhops and Governors thereof: <hi>Secondly,</hi> what power it cannot pretend unto, nor ought to be yielded to any Church, or Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <p n="1">I. As for the firſt of theſe, what the power is we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Church, when we ſay it upholds, maintains and teſtifies to the Truth, it is as much as to enquire of what Authority the Teſtimony of the Church is, how much it ought to weigh with us, and how far we ought to yield to it: to the Teſtimony, for inſtance, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church of which we are Members (for it hath as much Authority as any other) when it propounds Truth to us, and preſſes it upon our belief. Are we to believe it, meerly becauſe the Church ſaith it?</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to which we affirm, that the Teſtimony of the Church, is that whereby we are both <hi>informed</hi> of the Truth, and
<hi>induced,</hi> as by the <hi>firſt external</hi> motive to Faith in Chriſt. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> calls it the <hi>Key,</hi> as others do the
<hi>Door,</hi> which lets us into the knowledge of the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, which is preſerved in this Houſe of God.</p>
                  <p>If we allow it not this, we allow it nothing: nor can it, or any Perſon in it, be ſaid to be a <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> unleſs it do ſomething to the bringing us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Truth; which it propounds and ſets before us, and teſtifies to be that which Chriſt hath left with his Church, to be delivered down to all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62912:53"/>For it conveys the Holy Scriptures to us, and calls upon us to conſider and ſtudy them: that therein, by the help of the Paſtors of the Church (to whom this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I have ſhown, principally belongs) we may find all neceſſary Truths, in order to our Salvation. Which Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony being the Teſtimony of Men, that profeſs Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Honeſty and a good Conſcience, as the great thing in their Religion, is the higheſt of all humane Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and cannot but work very ſtrongly and powerfully upon Mens minds, when Chriſtians are ſuch as they profeſs to be: and as they are, it ought to work thus far upon all ſorts of Men, even upon thoſe who are out of the Church; as to incline them to have a reverend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that Faith and thoſe Scriptures, and to look into them and conſider them; which they ſee ſuch multitudes of People, and ſome of them very wiſe, as well as devout, conſtantly eſteem as the very Truth of God, tranſmitted to them from his Son, by the Apoſtles, who attended on him from his firſt appearing, till he went to Heaven.</p>

<hi>Novices</hi> and weaklings, who are as yet doubtful in the Faith, though in the Church: the Teſtimony and Authority of it, ought to confirm and quiet their minds (as it did S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, it appears by the place before-named) and keep them cloſe to the Chriſtian Society, till they may themſelves come better acquainted with the Truth, and more fully underſtand the Holy Scriptures, which the Church delivers to them, and puts into their hands, as the Word of God.

                  <p>Thus much is indiſputable; for God hath appointed outward means for the conveying Divine Truth, to our Belief; and this means is ordinarily the Church: to which we aſcribe theſe two great things, in this buſineſs.<note n="(p)" place="margin">Anſwer to Charity mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,

                  <p>But further than this, we cannot, we muſt not go. For the laſt reſolution of our Faith is not into the Teſtimony
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62912:55"/>of the Church, but into the Teſtimony of God himſelf, which we find recorded in the Holy Scripture, delivered by the Church unto us. Thus S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> moſt admirably diſcourſes in that very Book againſt <hi>Manichaeus</hi>
                     <note n="(q)" place="margin">Cap. <hi>XIV.</hi> contra Epiſt. quam vocant Fundamenti.</note> his Letter, from whence the fore-named ſaying, <hi>(I had not believed the Goſpel, unleſs the Churches Authority had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to it)</hi> is wont, at every turn, to be objected to us, by thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> perſwaſion. <hi>Thou doſt nothing, but praiſe what thou believeſt, and deride what I believe.</hi> Now ſince I can be even with thee, <hi>and do the very ſame, praiſe what I believe, and deride what thou believeſt; what is to be done? but that we leave and relinquiſh thoſe, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us to know things certain; and afterwards require us to believe things uncertain</hi> (let thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church mark this) <hi>and that we follow them, who invite us firſt to believe, that which we cannot yet ſee into; that being made ſtronger in the Faith it ſelf, we may come to underſtand what we believe:</hi> NOT MEN NOW, BUT GOD HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF INWARDLY ESTABLISHING AND IL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUMINATING OUR MIND.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to read this paſſage, and not ſee that this Father thought our Faith is not ultimately reſolved into the Teſtimony of the Church: but by that, being invited to believe the Holy Scriptures, we are eſtabliſhed (upon the ſerious reading of them) in the Chriſtian Faith, and Knowledge of the Truth, by God himſelf. Upon whoſe
<hi>Word,</hi> in the Holy Scripture, and not upon <hi>Men,</hi> we bottom our Faith. Upon the Teſtimony and Authority of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: and the Teſtimony of divine Men, inſpired by them; who by Miracles, and Signs, and mighty Deeds, and a prophetical Spirit, proved themſelves to be ſent of God; and have left his Mind and Will upon Record in the Scriptures of Truth. Which the Church indeed, in all parts of the World hath kept and preſerved, and faithfully <pb n="99" facs="tcp:62912:55"/>tranſmitted down to us; and now propounds to our Faith: but it is not merely what the Church ſaith, that makes us believe; but what God himſelf ſaith in the Holy Scriptures, concerning his Son Jeſus Chriſt; and what Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, concerning his riſing from the Dead, and ſending the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles. Which being fulfilled, evidently proved him to be the Son of God, the Saviour of the World: and them to be his Apoſtles, and Miniſters, who declared to Men the true way of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>So the Church directs and guides us to the Scriptures of Truth; but they reſolve and aſſure our Faith, being the very Word of God. The authority of God's Church is the firſt motive, which leads us to eſteem the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: but being led thither, we find in the matter of them that which gives us full ſatisfaction, by beſtowing our pains in reading, or hearing, and conſidering the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries contained therein. The Church holds out this light to us; but it is by this light that we ſee what is the mind and will of God. To this the Church points us, and bids us attend to it; for this it diſpoſes and prepares us; it leads us by the hand to this as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſure foundation of our Faith; (becauſe herein we find God himſelf ſpeaking to us) and moreover by the Miniſtery of the Church we are aſſiſted in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſence of the Holy Scriptures: but they contain in themſelves that Divine Authority and Truth, whereby we come to a certain Faith. The Church tells us ſuch and ſuch things are true; and we find them to be ſo, by examining the Scriptures. Which the <hi>Beraeans ſearched daily, whether thoſe things were ſo,</hi> which the Apoſtles preached: <hi>and therefore many of them believed;</hi> not merely becauſe the Apoſtles told them they ought ſo to do, but becauſe they found what they ſaid, in the Holy Scriptures, XVII. <hi>Act.</hi> 11, 12.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62912:56"/>And ſo far as any Church ſpeaks according to the truth contained therein, it is to be believed and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But if it bring no Divine word for its warrant, if it propound other Doctrines, which are not there, it hath no authority to make ſuch Doctrines, the matter of our Faith: much leſs, to ſet up its own authority above the Scriptures; as they do who ſay, The Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their authority from the Church Which is the Doctrine of no leſs Men than <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to name no more.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is very preſumptuous talk: for by the Church they mean themſelves; and then by the teſtimony of the Church (that is their own teſtimony) they mean ſuch a Divine witneſs, as aſſures us by its own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, without any other proof. Which are the great points of difference between us, in this matter. For we aſſert, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the office of leading Men to the Holy Scriptures, and ſo to Faith, belongs to every Church as much as to them: and, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that no Church can bring People to Faith by its own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and authority, but by the Doctrine of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures: nor is any Church whatſoever to be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62912:56"/>heard in matters of Divine Truth, further than it can prove its Doctrines by the authority of God's Word, and teaches things agreeable thereunto.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <p n="2">II. Which leads to the <hi>Second</hi> thing; briefly to ſhew what power and authority the Church cannot pretend unto in matters of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And, <hi>firſt,</hi> it appears by what hath been ſaid, that it hath not a <hi>Soveraign, Abſolute, Prophetical</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>independent</hi> upon the Rule of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: ſo that we muſt take whatſoever it ſaith for true, without conſulting them. This is the ambitious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the great Doctors of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, who give the Church (meaning thereby the preſent
<hi>Roman</hi> Church) an authority over all things, not depending on the Scriptures; but upon which the Scriptures themſelves depend: So that without the authority of this Church, all truth is doubtful. Which is a manifeſt principle of Infidelity; making all Religion ſtand to the courteſie of a company of Men, who in ſuch matters are the leaſt to be truſted of all other Chriſtians that we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Church hath no authority to propound any Doctrine, as neceſſary to Salvation, which is not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Holy Scriptures; but depends ſolely on the authority of its own Tradition. This is another of their ambitious attempts, who having arrogated to themſelves alone the whole power of the Church; make that power ſo unlimited, that it can ſupply the defects of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and make things unwritten to become matters of Faith. Which is ſuch an unbounded Prerogative, that we may have a new Faith, as often as they pleaſe to pretend a Tradition for it; though they cannot prove it. For we muſt reſt in the authority of the preſent Church which affirms it; and that againſt the very Scripture it <pb n="102" facs="tcp:62912:57"/>ſelf, which tells us it is able <hi>to make a Man of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> and againſt the teſtimony of the Univerſal Church, which, I have ſhown, forbids the producing of any other Faith but that which was evidently delivered by the Apoſtles there.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We cannot allow the Church an Infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, ſuch an aſſiſtance in her Doctrines and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, that ſhe cannot err in any thing ſhe defines. In Controverſies indeed ariſing about matters of Faith, we own and reverence the authority of the Church<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Artic.</hi> XX.</note>; ſo as not to conteſt the publique judgement, but to prefer it before our own private conceits, in doubtful things. But as it ought to proceed in its determinations by the Rule of Gods word; So we think it poſſible it may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the application of this Rule: and therefore we do not blindly reſign our ſelves to its authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all regard to the Holy Scriptures; unto which the Church ought to have a reſpect in all its determinations. No, that's another proud pretence of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that they cannot miſtake in their definitions: and therefore we muſt ſubmit unto them without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. From whence this intollerable miſchief hath inſued, that it hath made them both inſenſible of their errors, and careleſs to ſeek any cure of them, nay utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incapable of a remedy. For as one of our own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines excellently ſpeaks<note n="(u)" place="margin">Dr.

<hi>both a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon for that which is moſt unreaſonable; and a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient anſwer to that which is moſt unanſwerable.</hi> To this they retreat upon all occaſions, when they are not able to maintain their ground: they have no other way to defend their errors, when they are plainly ſet before their eyes, but to tell us confidently they cannot err. Which is a very ſtrange boldneſs; for we demonſtrate, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay inſtances, that they have erred; erred moſt groſly: <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62912:57"/>particularly in this, that they have added <hi>new Articles</hi> to the old Creed, to be believed under pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and added a <hi>new Canon</hi> of Scripture to the Old Teſtament, againſt the cleareſt evidence in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Univerſal Church, that the Books they have newly received, were never acknowledged for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture.</p>
                  <p>If by the <hi>Church</hi> indeed, they would underſtand, the Church truly Catholique, the whole Body of Chriſt in all times, places and ages; and if by <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> they would underſtand thoſe grand Articles which I have mentioned in the firſt part of this Diſcourſe; and if by being <hi>Infallible,</hi> they would underſtand not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute impoſſibility of erring (which humane nature is not capable of) but not actual error: there are none of us make any queſtion, but the Church is Infallible. That is, the whole Church hath not erred, nor ſhall not err, in the whole Faith, or in any neceſſary part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for ſuch error would cut Men off from Chriſt, the head; and ſo leave him no Church at all; which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. It hath been the very ſcope of firſt my Diſcourſe, to ſhow that the Church hath always kept the great fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental truths of our Religion, and not erred in them; but tranſmitted them down to us, whole and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: till the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> corrupted the Faith, by their errors, which they have mixed with it.</p>
                  <p>For to a particular Church, ſuch as that of <hi>Rome</hi> is, we cannot allow this priviledge of not erring: becauſe we know they have erred, even in fundamental Truths, and thereby ceaſed to be Churches.

<hi>obligation</hi> to it. As when our Saviour ſaith to his Diſciples,
<hi>Ye are the ſalt of the Earth:</hi> it doth not ſignifie that they were neceſſarily ſo (for he ſuppoſes immediately the <hi>ſalt might loſe its ſavour</hi>) but that they ought to be ſo; and if they were not ſo, would be <hi>good for nothing, but to be caſt out and trodden under foot.</hi> Matth. V. 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> The firſt Churches of Chriſt, in the Apoſtles times, were <hi>actu &amp; effectu,</hi> actually and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually the <hi>Pillar of Truth:</hi> that is, they faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd <pb n="105" facs="tcp:62912:58"/>this Office, and perform'd their Duty, conſtantly maintaining the Truth as it is in Chriſt, in its purity and ſimplicity. For the Apoſtles were a part of thoſe Churches, whom God led
<hi>into all Truth:</hi> which they taught ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and intirely while they lived; and do at this day, inſtruct us, in the Holy Scriptures, in the whole Truth, neceſſary to our Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But we cannot ſay the ſame of all ſucceeding Churches, that they did faithfully perform this office, though in duty they alſo were bound ſo to do. No, ſome of them were ſo far from being
<hi>Pillars of the Truth,</hi> that they let it fall to the ground. We have ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, with which I ſhall not fill theſe Papers, in the Hiſtory of the Church: which ſhow us that if we take not heed to our ſelves, and the Doctrine that is delivered to us, we have no ſecurity, that we, or any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, ſhall continue firm and ſtedfaſt ſupporters of the Truth. For <hi>Pillars</hi> themſelves may decay; and, if they be not well lookt after, will go to ruin, and fall to the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Even this very Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which was a <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> while <hi>Timothy</hi> preſided in it, afterward began, before all the Apoſtles were dead, to remit its

                  <p>And yet for all this, the ſpeech of the Apoſtle is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per enough: For a Church or its Paſtor may be the <hi>Pillar of Truth,</hi> in regard of their duty, as I have often ſaid, though they prove negligent in their Office.

<hi>they were departed out of the way, and cauſed many to ſtumble at the Law: and had corrupted the Covenant of Levi,</hi> Mal. II. 7, 8. The like we read in other places of the holy Book, that the Prophets were not true to their truſt, but declared the viſions of their own heart, not the Word of the Lord: and lead the people into error and falſhood; feeding them with lies, inſtead of Truth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Further I muſt obſerve, that there is no promiſe made to any particular Church, that it ſhall always be a Pillar of Truth: no not to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which <pb n="107" facs="tcp:62912:59"/>now ſo boldly lays claim, and that ſolely, to this priviledge. But quite contrary there is a terrible threatning to this very Church, included in that admonition which this very Apoſtle gives them. Which is ſufficient to ſhow that Chriſt gave no ſuch priviledge to this Church, as that it ſhould never err: but directly contrary, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it might err, and err even to Apoſtaſie; when he bids them take heed leſt they were cut off by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, from the fellowſhip of the Saints. Read XI. <hi>Rom.</hi> 20, 21, 22. <hi>They</hi> (ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews</hi>)
<hi>were broken off by unbelief: and thou</hi> (ſpeaking to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians) <hi>ſtandeſt by faith. Be not high minded, but fear.</hi> (hearken to this, O ye of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church).
<hi>For if God ſpared not the natural branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee. Behold the goodneſs and ſeverity of God: on them which fell, ſeverity; but towards thee, goodneſs, if thou continue in his goodneſs: OTHERWISE THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> ALSO SHALT BE C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T OF.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence we may thus argue; if God had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, the priviledge of being a Pillar of Truth, infallibly and immutably, unto all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; all theſe ſuppoſitions were vain, and theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations utterly needleſs and frivolous: for it would have been abſolutely impoſſible, it ſhould be cut off, and abſolutely neceſſary it ſhould continue. And yet the Apoſtle plainly ſuppoſes otherwiſe, and took it for granted it might fail. For theſe two are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, to <hi>ſtand</hi> and to <hi>fall;</hi> to
<hi>continue,</hi> and to be <hi>cut off;</hi> to be an Everlaſting
<hi>Pillar,</hi> and to be <hi>broken off.</hi> For it is proper to a Pillar to ſtand and ſupport: but to be cut off, (as he ſuppoſes they might be) is to fall to the Ground, and not to be able to ſupport ones ſelf, much leſs others.</p>

                  <p>Now that they of that Church have gone far towards this condition (according to the Apoſtles ſuppoſition) by falſifying the Truth of Chriſt, even part of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Faith (and ſo have not continued a firm and ſtedfaſt Pillar of Truth, but maintained and ſupported dangerous Errors and Hereſies) is apparent from this alone, if there were no more: that they limit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Catholique Church to themſelves alone; and exclude all other Chriſtians from it, who will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their Biſhop and Decrees. The Impiety of which is ſo great, that it is not eaſie to be expreſſed: for it is in Truth, to make the Church not <hi>Catholique</hi> but Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.

                        <hi>The Church cannot err in Faith or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> it muſt be thus taken, according to the Doctrine of the Fathers; <hi>that God doth ſo aſſiſt his Church to the end of the World, that the true Faith ſhall never fail out of the ſame.</hi> For to the World's end, there ſhall be no time, wherein <hi>ſome, though all,</hi> ſhall not have true Faith working by Love.</q> Unto this expoſition we heartily ſubmit: but that the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or indeed any other particular Church, cannot degenerate, and depart from the right Faith, we can by no means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; but think our ſelves bound by the moſt ſacred tyes, to oppoſe theſe arrogant pretences, <hi>that the Church is Infallible, and that they are the Church.</hi> They are no more the Church, than any other company of Men, profeſſing the Chriſtian Faith: nor ſo much neither, for there are truer Believers than they.

                  <p>And therefore let no Man be ſo forgetful of theſe things as to truſt them to be his Guides; fancying they cannot miſlead him. They have miſled thoſe that rely upon them; and have led them into a

                  <p>Theſe things I have only briefly toucht (which are more largely handled in other Books) that the Readers may be ſenſible how happy they are who are freed from theſe Impoſtures. And that our People may know their duty, in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> whereof by the Grace of God they are Members; I ſhall conclude this Treatiſe with <hi>Six</hi> Conſiderations more: whereby the whole, I hope, will be made more uſeful.</p>

For we openly profeſs and recite twice a day in our own Language, that every one may underſtand it, the whole Chriſtian Faith, compriſed in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Creed: with the explication of ſome part of this Faith, by the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Fathers, once every week or more: and a more diſtinct Explication of the ſame Articles, by

Turn away your Ears both from the one and the other: for as the former is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant ſound, ſo the latter (all their Arguments) are but confident Sophiſtry.

                  <p n="3">III. And thus every one is bound to teach his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren diligently; inſtructing and confirming them in theſe main Points of Chriſtianity: that ſo the Truth may live, when we are gone.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, I beſeech you, what a neceſſary duty this is. How ſhould the Truth be preſerved and ſupported, but by thoſe that believe it? And how ſhould they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, who do not underſtand it? And how ſhould they underſtand it, unleſs they be taught and inſtructed in it? And who ſo much concerned to inſtruct their Children, as they that brought them into the World? Their God-fathers and God-mothers indeed are engaged to ſee this done; but their Parents have a further, even a natural obligation to it. And therefore ought firſt of all diligently to inform themſelves; and by attending to all the means of inſtruction, which they have in this Church, to increaſe in true Chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: that they may be able to teach thoſe who are committed to their care, and prepare them to be cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed <pb n="114" facs="tcp:62912:63"/>and further inſtructed by thoſe whom God hath ſet over them.</p>
                  <p>We are not Pillars and ſupporters of the Truth, but the betrayers of it; if we take no care about this. Which is one great reaſon why ſome have eaſily forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the true Religion here taught and profeſſed, and condemned this Church (an horrid crime, if you ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh the conſequents of it) by renouncing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it, as no part of the Body of Chriſt. Men may be ſoon perſwaded, by confident talkers, to part with that, which they do not underſtand: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they apprehend any danger in keeping it, or hope to gain by letting it go. Why ſhould they haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the leaſt hair of their Head, for they know not what? Nay, why ſhould they be at all concerned for it, any more than a Man is for the ſeed that is ſcattered in the High-way, from which he expects no Crop? To that, you know, our bleſſed Lord compared him that <hi>heareth the word of the Kingdom, and underſtandeth it not: for then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his heart,</hi> Matth. XIII. 19.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. You muſt endeavour therefore to profit by all ſuch inſtructions as theſe: and to grow in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> where God hath revealed his whole mind and will to you, and plainly publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all thoſe Truths, which belong to the <hi>great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of godlineſs.</hi> You ought, for inſtance, to take heed, how you wantonly and looſely interpret, or apply them, according to your own ſudden or careleſs fancies (that's a great profanation of the Sacred Books) and yet you muſt not, for fear of this, be perſwaded to throw them out of your hands; but rather with the more ſolemn, humble and reverend awe of God, upon your Souls, ponder and weigh what you read therein: eſpecially
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62912:63"/>thoſe things which are plain and evident to every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that by the help of them, and of thoſe whom God hath ſet over you to guide and direct your minds; you may either inform your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in what appears to have difficulty in it, or ſatisfie your ſelves that it is not neceſſary you ſhould underſtand it.</p>
                  <p>For they that would drive you from this hold of the Holy Scriptures, intend to deceive you; and would have you depend on that which is far more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than the meaning of any place of Scripture can be. There is no firm ground for us to ſtand upon, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this: which all acknowledge is the very word of God, and delivers that, which hath been ever accounted the ſubſtance of Chriſtian Doctrines; in ſuch words as every one may underſtand them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore this is, as I have ſaid, the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon which the Church is built. Which is the <hi>Pillar of Truth,</hi> as it defends the Truth out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and by the Scriptures, againſt all Hereticks and other oppoſers: and as it eſtabliſhes and ſupports it, in the hearts of Men, by this means, that it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to Poſterity. This muſt be added, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all that hath been ſaid; that the Church, and every perſon in it, great or ſmall, are <hi>Pillars</hi> not by themſelves, but by the Holy Scriptures.

<hi>Faith is ſtill inquired after, as if there were no Faith already: Faith is to be written, as if it were not in the heart: being regenerated by Faith, we are now taught what to believe, as if that Regeneration were without Faith.

                  <p>We deſerve not the name of Chriſtians, no nor of Men, if we ſtand not up reſolutely, againſt ſuch uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations and corruptions of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and maintain that Faith, which we profeſs and wherein we ſtand, to be <hi>the true Grace of God; the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi> Which is incumbent chiefly upon the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church, who, I have ſhown, are the <hi>Principal Pillars of the Truth,</hi> (as <hi>Timothy</hi> was in the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi>) and therefore ought to appear, with all their might, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of God's true Religion here eſtabliſhed: inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62912:68"/>teaching, exhorting, all committed to their charge to be ſtedfaſt and immoveable in it to the death. And every honeſt hearted Chriſtian ought to do the ſame, in his rank and condition, by following thoſe inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by fortifying himſelf againſt <hi>Romiſh</hi> deluſions; by indeavouring to underſtand the Truth, and to detect their Errors.</p>
                  <p>Which are the more earneſtly to be oppoſed, becauſe the new Articles of their Creed, are not a Myſtery of Godlineſs; but tend, many of them, to nurſe Men up ſecurely in their ſins: ſuch as the Doctrines of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> of <hi>Penances,</hi> and (to name to more) of <hi>Infallibility:</hi> which being preſumed, as an

                  <p>This pernicious Doctrine, I may add, ſeems alſo to be deeply rooted in all their minds; that an <hi>Orthodox Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief will ſave them.</hi> For this they make the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtianity, to bring Men, as they think, to ſuch a Faith: as appears by this, that let Men be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo bad, their labour is not beſtowed to make them quit their Sins, but to bring them to their Belief; where, for any thing I can ſee or hear, they may quietly enjoy them. Nay, there are a number of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle devices, to put them in hope of Heaven, without reforming their lives; provided they Believe as the Church Believes.</p>
                  <p>And in this let me beſeech all that read theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to take a ſpecial care, that they do not imitate them. Let us be watchful, that we do not put a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cheat upon our ſelves, than they would do: by imagining our ſelves good Chriſtians, meerly becauſe <pb n="125" facs="tcp:62912:68"/>we Zealouſly oppoſe the Errors of Popery. That we ought to do; but not leave the great Thing, the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lives, undone. For may we not deſtroy and pull down by a wicked life, as much as we build up by contending for the Faith? How can others think that we are ſo much concerned, as we ſeem to be for Truth; when we make no uſe of it; but let it lie dead in our minds? What pitty is it, that their hearts ſhould not love that which is good, whoſe minds are inlightned to diſcern that which is true? That their underſtandings being convinced, their wills ſhould not alſo be converted? It is a lamentable thing, to profeſs that we know God, but in our Works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him. This makes us look as if we were of a Faction, rather than of the Faithful: who oppoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers rather as our Enemies, than as Chriſt's; as thoſe that differ from us, rather than as thoſe that differ from the Truth.</p>
                  <p>For if it be the Truth, that we Reverence, why do we not let it Rule and Govern us? Why do we not love to have it nearer to us, than in our Brains? even in our Hearts and Affections. For there is no greater Truth than this, that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs is the worſt of Hereſies;</hi> a wicked life the moſt oppoſite, of all other things, to the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                  <p>Let us never forget therefore that Admonition of the Apoſtle in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Chapter of this Epiſtle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> v. 19.
